# AI Learning Projects
**An exploration of AI concepts and techniques through coursework, assignments, and practical coding exercises.**

## Overview
This repository is a collection of AI-focused projects and exercises that I completed as part of my studies in Artificial Intelligence. The projects here cover a range of topics, including data preprocessing, machine learning models, and natural language processing. Each project demonstrates foundational skills and aims to build a strong understanding of AI principles.

**Note:** Variable names, dataset names, and specific details have been anonymized to protect original coursework content.

## Contents
1. **Data Preprocessing and Cleaning**: Basic techniques for handling missing data, data normalization, and feature engineering.
2. **Machine Learning Models**: Implementations of foundational machine learning algorithms with anonymized data.
3. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Introduction to text data processing and simple NLP models.

## Installation & Dependencies
To run the notebooks in this repository, you will need Python 3 and the following packages:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `nltk` (for NLP tasks)

Install these packages using pip: 

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn nltk
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/FanmeiWang/AI_Learning_Projects.git
```
2. Navigate to the repository folder:
```bash
cd AI_Learning_Projects
```
3. Open any of the Jupyter notebooks to start exploring the projects.
